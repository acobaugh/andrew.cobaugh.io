I've spent the last ~15 years as a System Administrator, HPC Admin, System Designer, Software Engineer, and most recently a DevOps Engineer currently working for [Updater](https://updater.com). Previously I was at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu).

My professional interests are around Kubernetes, Golang, distributed systems, configuration management, automation, monitoring, metrics, cloud computing, immutable infrastructure, infrastructure as code, containers, Kerberos, LDAP, and IPv6 evangelism.

[For fun](https://labs.cobaugh.io), I enjoy welding, fabrication, machining, machine restoration (lathes, milling machines, tractors, motorcycles, etc), firearms, building Tesla coils, 3D modeling, and riding and working on motorcycles (vintage Honda inline 4s, mostly). 

I'm also a volunteer for the local historical railroad where I maintain our website, as well as help with maintenance of way activities, rolling stock maintenance, ticket sales, and excursion operations. I hope to become certified as a locomotive engineer in 2018 with the return of our Budd Rail Diesel Car, which is currently undergoing restoration.

I hold a general class amateur radio license, callsign KB3EWY. I'm not active much, but when I am I'm on 2M FM, 2M APRS, 10M SSB, and 10M FT8..
